# Crossword Puzzle Solver with NLP

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a crossword puzzle game that features an AI solver powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The AI solver will analyze crossword clues using NLP algorithms to generate accurate answers efficiently, enhancing the user experience and making crossword puzzles more accessible.

## AI Technology
The chosen AI technology for this project is NLP, which enables the analysis and understanding of human language. By leveraging NLP algorithms and libraries, such as OpenNLP, the AI solver will process textual clues to identify keywords, extract relevant information, and generate solutions for the crossword puzzle. The utilization of NLP allows the AI solver to process clues in a manner similar to how a human would approach the task.

## Implementation
The project will be implemented in Java, with NLP tasks handled by OpenNLP, a free machine learning toolkit that provides various NLP functionalities, including tokenizers, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution.

The crossword clues will be sourced from a GitHub repository containing JSON files of New York Times crossword clues. This dataset should provide a diverse and challenging set of clues for the AI solver to tackle.

## Analysis
The success of the project will be determined by the accuracy and speed of the AI solver. Accuracy metrics will be derived from the percentage of correctly solved clues, reflecting the AI's ability to comprehend and respond to varied linguistic contexts. Additionally, the speed of the AI solver in completing entire puzzles will be measured, gauging its efficiency in real-time puzzle-solving scenarios.

Through rigorous analysis and experimentation, insights into the performance and limitations of the AI solver will be garnered, informing future advancements in NLP-driven applications.
